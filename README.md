# student-database

A database that pairs SSN numbers and Last Names, simulating a student database.

SSN's must be 9 digits long. Last Name can be anything except blank.

Users can "Add" students into the database, "Find" students via their SSN, and then "Modify" and "Delete" entries once they are pulled up. Users can also "Show" a list of all the students and their SSN's.

This was built using a SortedList to keep track of everything.
